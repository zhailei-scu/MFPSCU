   &TEMPERATURE The simulation temperature = 1000 (K)

   &MATRIXVOLUM The matrix atoms volumn = 1.5855D-2  ! (nm^3) ! the symbol ATOMVOLUM denote this elements would be use as a matrix and the atom volum need to be special

   &MAXCHANGERATE The max change rate in each step is 0.05

   &STARTCONCENTRATE The start atoms concentrate is 1.D20      ! 1/(cm^3)

   &TARGETCONCENTRATE The target atoms concentrate is 1.D20      ! 1/(cm^3)

   &IMPLANTRATE The implant atoms number per seconds unit volum =  0.D0                 ! (1/(cm^3*s))
