!--------The following are the global macro that used for mcpscu--------------
!----------------Zhai Lei, 2019/01/14-----------------


! We define the PreAssign macro for the reason of the potiential problem in pgice cygwin 17.10 and 18.4.
! The details is below, assume we define derived fortran type A and B like following:
!         TYPE,PUBLIC::A
!            integer::member = 0
!	  END TYPE
!
!         TYPE,PUBLIC::B
!            integer::member
!	  END TYPE
!
! Obviously, the only different between type A and B is that type A assign a init value for the member, but B not.
! When these derived are used in pgi linux version, everything is OK. However, when we use these derived type in
! pgice windows version(just cygwin environment), the error would occur in kernel while compiling.
! The position of the error happed like follow :
! attributes(global) subroutine Testkernel()
!   !---Local Vars---
!   type(A)::a
!   type(B)::b
!   integer::int_a
!   integer::int_b
!   !---Body---
!   int_a = a%member    ! wrong while compiling
!   int_b = b%member    ! OK while compiling
!
!   return
! end subroutine
!
! If we add -w -v compiling option, we would see that compiler print "xxxxx_A is undifined."
! So, in windows cygwin, we should not assign any member of derived fortran type an init value.
